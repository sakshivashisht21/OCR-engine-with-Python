# OCR-engine-with-Python
In this project we have to build an optical character recognition system using neural networks  Part 1 Here we will develop and test an OCR application that recognizes text from image data and view it by converting it into 2D images. Part 2 An OCR engine is to be created using Artificial Neural Network. The image dataset to be used in this project is the letter.data dataset (found in letter.data.gz which is available on http://ai.stanford.edu/~btaskar/ocr/ . The data will be splitted into training and test data. About 70% of the entire dataset has to be trained and the rest 30% of the dataset has to be tested. Then we will compare the test data with the standard training data to determine if a predicted character matches the actual one.
